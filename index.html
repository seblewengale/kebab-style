         <p>Nature is a wonderful thing. We get everything from nature:
            metal, brick, material. Nature gives us so many things to write about:
            its life, its warmth and many things more.The mountain, the tree, the animal, give us a delight in
             and for themselves</p>

         <p>When man refuses to acknowledge his responsibility to care for nature,
           destruction occurs. Devastation happens either by omission or commission.
            Animals disappear and become endangered or extinct because of irresponsible
            hunting. Plant life is essentially destroyed by incessant cutting of
            trees and burning of grasslands. The atmosphere is being damaged
            by pollution. Global warming destroys land masses as the sea rises
            because of increasing temperatures. It even causes the growth
            and rapid spread of different kinds of bacteria and viruses.There are
            people who are directly responsible for the devastation in our surroundings
             while there are also  people who do not even think about it.</P>

      <p>Being environmentally friendly simply means having a lifestyle that are better
         for the environment. Its all about taking small steps towards mother earth so
         as to make this planet a better place for our communities and generations to come.
         A good way would be to start with conserving water, driving less and walking more,
         consuming less energy, buying recycled products, eating locally grown vegetables,
         joining environmental groups to combat air pollution,
         creating less waste, planting more trees and many more.</p>
